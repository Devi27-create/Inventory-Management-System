# Inventory-Management-System

# Introduction
The Inventory Management System is a comprehensive system designed to efficiently manage and track the availability of various products within a stock inventory. This system not only provides information on specific products and their quantities but also stores critical details regarding suppliers and the transactions pertaining to each product.

# Problem Statement
An effective inventory management system empowers businesses to answer fundamental questions related to their inventory. Notably, it can provide insights into product availability and the quantity of each specific item currently in stock. This valuable information helps identify which products are in need of replenishment. Additionally, the system can highlight top-selling items, allowing businesses to strategize better. With these analytics, companies are also equipped to calculate total revenue over specific time periods, providing a clearer picture of their financial performance.

# Datasets used
For this case, we utilized four essential datasets that serve as the backbone of our inventory management system:

1. **Products**: This dataset includes detailed information on all products, capturing the product ID and product name alongside their corresponding prices and categories. It serves as a foundational element for identifying items within the inventory.

2. **Inventory**: The inventory dataset contains critical information related to each product's stock. It comprises product IDs and inventory IDs, as well as quantities for each product. Additionally, it tracks the associated supplier IDs and records the last updated date for inventory levels, ensuring that data remains current.

3. **Transactions**: This dataset holds all transaction activities, capturing transaction IDs and product IDs while specifying the quantity involved in each transaction. It also distinguishes between transaction types—whether a product has been sold or purchased—along with the corresponding transaction dates for accurate record-keeping.

4. **Suppliers**: The suppliers dataset provides essential contact information regarding product suppliers. It includes supplier IDs and names, as well as contact emails and phone numbers, facilitating smooth communication and relationships with vendors.

These datasets work in harmony to create an effective and insightful inventory management solution.
